Based on our legitimate interest to promote the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace we may display parts of the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace (e.g., your Listing page) on sites operated by Caf&eacute; Temps&rsquo;s business partners, using technologies such as widgets or APIs. If your Listings are displayed on a partner&rsquo;s site, information from your public profile page may also be displayed.

      <p>Where appropriate, we may notify Members about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Caf&eacute; Temps&rsquo;s property, its Members and the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.</p>
      <h3>3.5 Service Providers</h3>
      <p>Caf&eacute; Temps uses a variety of third party service providers to help us provide services related to the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace. Service providers may be located inside or outside of the United States (&ldquo;USA&rdquo;).</p>

Caf&eacute; Temps will need to share your information, including personal information, in order to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you.</p>
      <h3>3.6 Social Media Marketplaces</h3>
      <p>Where permissible according to applicable law we may use certain limited personal information about you, such as listing details, to hash it and to share it with social media Marketplaces, such as Facebook or Google, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise promote our products and services or the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace. These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products or services that may be of your interest. The social media platforms with which we may share your personal data are not controlled or supervised by Caf&eacute; Temps. Therefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform service provider processes your personal data should be directed to such a provider. Please note that you may, at any time, ask Caf&eacute; Temps to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an email to <a href="mailto:admin@cafetemps.com">admin@cafetemps.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>3.7 Business Transfers</h3>
      <p>If Caf&eacute; Temps undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence).

      <h3>3.8 Aggregated Data</h3>
      <p>We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other anonymized information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</p>
      <h2>4. Other Important Information</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Analyzing your Communications</h3>
      <p>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications. These activities are carried out based on Caf&eacute; Temps's legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and our Terms, preventing fraud, promoting safety, and improving and ensuring the adequate performance of our services.</p>
      <h3>4.2 Mapbox</h3>
      <p>Parts of the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace use Mapbox geolocation services, including the Mapbox API(s). Use of Mapbox is subject to Mabbox Additional Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h2>5. Third Party Partners &amp; Integrations</h2>
      <p>The Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace may contain links to third party websites or services, such as third party integrations, co-branded services, or third party-branded services (&ldquo;Third Party Partners&rdquo;).

      <h3>6.4 Data Retention and Erasure</h3>
      <p>We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations.

Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an Caf&eacute; Temps Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that Caf&eacute; Temps Account to prevent that Member from opening a new Caf&eacute; Temps Account in the future.</li>
      <li>We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Caf&eacute; Temps may keep some of your information for business reporting and auditing obligations.</li>
      <li>Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace, even after your Caf&eacute; Temps Account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.</li>
      <li>Because we maintain the Caf&eacute; Temps Marketplace to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>6.5 Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <p>Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by Caf&eacute; Temps you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by sending a communication to Caf&eacute; Temps specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Caf&eacute; Temps override your own.</p>
      <h3>6.7 Lodging Complaints</h3>
