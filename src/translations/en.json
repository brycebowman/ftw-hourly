  "SectionFAQWorker.Question1": "How do workers get paid?",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Answer1": "Workers get paid directly into their checking accounts within 48 hours of each booking.",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Question2": "How much can I charge?",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Answer2": "We suggest setting your hourly rate about 50% higher than your normal hourly wage.{pageBreak}Once you get some positive reviews, you may charge even more!",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Question3": "How do I get gigs?",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Answer3": "Restaurant managers search worker profiles and send booking requests to the workers in our marketplace.{pageBreak}Make sure your profile is up to date, with a clear profile photo. Your profile description should be fun and engaging. This is your opportunity to advertise yourself!",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Question4": "What About Taxes?",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Answer4": "All workers are treated as independent contractors. Our payment processor (Stripe) will send appropriate tax statements at the end of each calendar year.",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Question5": "Do I need a bank account to join as a worker?",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Answer5": "Yes, all workers need a valid bank account, since we only send payouts to checking accounts. This reduces the potential for fraud, and helps us verify your identify.",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Question6": "Do you share my address publicly?",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Answer6": "We do not share your address at anytime.Even hiring managers cannot see your address. {pageBreak}Further, your location on map searches is randomly moved within a radius to make it impossible for someone to locate your address from a simple search.",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Question7": "How do I communicate with a manager?",
  "SectionFAQWorker.Answer7": "You can send messages to the restaurant manager through your Inbox on Café Temps.",

  "SectionFAQManager.Question1": "How do you prevent fraud?",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer1": "Our payment processor uses photo ID and supporting data to validate the identify of every worker. {pageBreak}We also require a valid checking account for each worker.",
  "SectionFAQManager.Question2": "How much can I expect to pay?",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer2": "Generally, you should expect to pay 50% to 100% above what you would pay for similar full-time roles. {pageBreak}Remember, Café Temps workers are available on short notice, and you are not paying for any benefits (like health coverage, vacation days, etc.)",
  "SectionFAQManager.Question3": "What is Your Refund Policy?",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer3": "If a worker does not show up at the booking time, we provide a 100% refund and will remove the worker from our platform.{pageBreak}Beyond this, we do not offer refunds. We encourage restaurants to review each worker to help our talented workers get more gigs.",
  "SectionFAQManager.Question4": "Do You Provide Insurance?",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer4": "Café Temps does not provide insurance of any kind. We rely on the restaurants to provide their own business coverage in the event of an accident at the location.",
  "SectionFAQManager.Question5": "Can I  post a need and let workers apply?",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer5A": "Not yet. We decided on a direct hire process for now, for the following reasons: {pageBreak}(1) We want workers to set their own rates, and not be constrained to the rates of posted jobs.{pageBreak}(2) Job postings work best when there is a large pool of workers in the service area. We are still developing the talent pool at this time. We will consider implementing a gig posting process in the future.",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer5B": "Your booking requests expire after three hours, after which time you may elect to send a booking request to alternate workers.",
  "SectionFAQManager.Question6": "What if my worker doesn't meet expectations?",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer6A": "While we hope this rarely happens, sometimes people don't meet our expectations. In these cases, we rely on constructive reviews from restaurant managers to help the worker succeed in future roles.",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer6B": "Keep in mind that each restaurant is unique, and the first day at a new location is challenging for anyone. Be understanding, and give constructive guidance with your worker during their shift.",
  "SectionFAQManager.Question7": "How do I communicate with a worker?",
  "SectionFAQManager.Answer7": "You can send messages to the worker directly from the worker's profile on Café Temps. Also, after booking you will receive a valid phone number for the worker.",

  "SectionFAQLanding.Question2": "Do I Need Restaurant Experience to Join?",
